                    <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a language for specifying how documents are presented to
                    users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common
                    markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers,
                    like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a
                    computer screen, projector or printer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of
                    headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text
                    into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used
                    for effects such as animation.

            <header>Applying CSS</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it
                    to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                    across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from
                    the head of your document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <code>styles.css</code>. The
                    <code>.css</code> extension shows that this is a CSS file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To link <code>styles.css</code> to <code>index.html</code> add the following line somewhere inside
                    of the HTML document:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This <code> &ltlink&gt </code> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the
                    <code> rel </code> attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute.
                    You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to <code>styles.css</code>. Using your code editor add
                    the following to your CSS file:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        h1{ <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of
                    the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some
                    CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.

                <p>
                    Stylesheets <b>cascade</b> — at a very simple level, this means that the order of CSS rules matter;
                    when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that
                    will be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the below example, we have two rules that could apply to the <code>h1</code>. The <code>h1</code>
                    ends up being colored blue — these rules have an identical selector and therefore carry the same
                    specificity, so the last one in the source order wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        h1 { <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        h1 { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                        } 
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p class="example">
                    This is my heading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Inheritance</b> also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set on
                    parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you set a <code>color</code> and <code>font-family</code> on an element, every
                    element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, unless you've applied different
                    color and font values directly to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some properties do not inherit — for example, if you set a <code>width</code> of 50% on an element,
                    all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width. If this was the case, CSS
                    would be very frustrating to use!

            <article>
                <p>
                    In CSS, <b>selectors</b> are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to
                    style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when
                    selecting elements to style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that
                    tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the
                    rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as
                    the <i>subject of the selector</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This group includes selectors that target an HTML element such as an <code>&lth1&gt</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code> h1 { } </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also includes selectors which target a class:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>.box { }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    or, an ID:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>#unique { }</code>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Attribute selectors give you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain
                    attribute on an element:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>a[title] { }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>a[href="https://example.com"] { }</code>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Pseudo-classes style certain states of an element. The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class for example
                    selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>a:hover { }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element
                    itself. For example, <code>::first-line</code> always selects the first line of text inside an
                    element (a <code>&ltp&gt</code> in the below case):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>p::first-line { }</code>
                </p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="values_and_units">
            <header>Values and units</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    In CSS specifications and on the property pages here on MDN you will be able to spot value types as
                    they will be surrounded by angle brackets, such as <code>color</code> or <code>length</code>. When
                    you see the value type <code>color</code> as valid for a particular property, that means you can use
                    any valid color as a value for that property, as listed on the <code>color</code> reference page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following example, we have set the color of our heading using a keyword, and the background
                    using the <code>rgb()</code> function:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        h1 { <br>
                        color: black; <br>
                        background-color: rgb(197,93,161); <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numeric type you will come across most frequently is <code>&ltlength&gt</code>. For example
                    <code>10px</code> (pixels) or <code>30em</code>. There are two types of lengths used in CSS —
                    relative and absolute. It's important to know the difference in order to understand how big things
                    will become.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Absolute length units</b> are not relative to anything else, and are generally considered to
                    always be the same size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of these units are more useful when used for print, rather than screen output. For example, we
                    don't typically use <code>cm</code> (centimeters) on screen. The only value that you will commonly
                    use is <code>px</code> (pixels).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Relative length units</b> are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent
                    element's font, or the size of the viewport. The benefit of using relative units is that with some
                    careful planning you can make it so the size of text or other element scales relative to everything
                    else on the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> are the two relative lengths you are likely to encounter most
                    frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text. It's worth understanding how these work, and the
                    differences between them, especially when you start getting on to more complex subjects like styling
                    text or CSS layout. The below example provides a demonstration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start with, we set 16px as the font size on the <code>&lthtml&gt</code> element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To recap, the em unit means "my parent element's font-size" in the case of typography. The
                    <code>&ltli&gt</code> elements inside the <code>&ltul&gt</code> with a <code>class</code> of
                    <code>ems</code> take their sizing from their parent. So each successive level of nesting gets
                    progressively larger, as each has its font size set to <code>1.3em</code> — 1.3 times its parent's
                    font size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To recap, the rem unit means "The root element's font-size". (rem stands for "root em".) The
                    <code>&ltli&gt</code> elements inside the <code>&ltul&gt</code> with a <code>class</code> of
                    <code>rems</code> take their sizing from the root element (<code>&lthtml&gt</code>). This means that
                    each successive level of nesting does not keep getting larger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you change the <code>&lthtml&gt</code> <code>font-size</code> in the CSS you will see
                    that everything else changes relative to it — both <code>rem</code>- and <code>em</code>-sized text.

                    Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create
                    layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — <b>block boxes</b> and <b>inline boxes</b>. These
                    characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow, and in relation to other boxes
                    on the page:
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following ways:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
                    <li>The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In
                        most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the
                        space available.</li>
                    <li>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are respected.</li>
                    <li>Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless we decide to change the display type to inline, elements such as headings (e.g.
                    <code>&lth1&gt</code>) and <code>&ltp&gt</code> all use <code>block</code> as their outer display
                    type by default.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If a box has an outer display type of <code>inline</code>, then:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
                    <li>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties will not apply.</li>
                    <li>Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move
                        away from the box.</li>
                    <li>Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move
                        away from the box.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>&lta&gt</code> element, used for links, <code>&ltspan&gt</code>, <code>&ltem&gt</code> and
                    <code>&ltstrong&gt</code> are all examples of elements that will display inline by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The type of box applied to an element is defined by <code>display</code> property values such as
                    <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code>, and relates to the outer value of <code>display</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some of the behavior defined in
                    the box model. The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and
                    content — work together to create a box that you can see on the page.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Making up a block box in CSS we have the:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content box: The area where your content is displayed, which can be sized using properties like
                        <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.</li>
                    <li>Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; its size can be controlled
                        using <code>padding</code> and related properties.</li>
                    <li>Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its size and style can be
                        controlled using <code>border</code> and related properties.</li>
                    <li>Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as
                        whitespace between this box and other elements. Its size can be controlled using
                        <code>margin</code> and related properties.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                    The <code>background&#45;color</code> property defines the background color on any element in CSS.
                    The property accepts any valid <code>&ltcolor&gt</code>. A <code>background&#45;color</code> extends
                    underneath the content and padding box of the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the example below, we have used various color values to add a background color to the box, a
                    heading, and a <code>&ltspan&gt</code> element.
                </p>

                    <code>
                        &lt;div class="box"&gt; <br>
                        &lt;h2&gt;Background Colors&lt;/h2&gt; <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;Try changing the background &lt;span&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/div&gt;

                    <code>&lt;div class="box"&gt; <br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The <code>background-image</code> property enables the display of an image in the background of an
                    element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>background-repeat</code> property is used to control the tiling behavior of images. The
                    available values are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>no-repeat</code> — stop the background from repeating altogether.</li>
                    <li><code>repeat-x</code> — repeat horizontally.</li>
                    <li><code>repeat-y</code> — repeat vertically.</li>
                    <li><code>repeat</code> — the default; repeat in both directions.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When learning about the Box Model, we discovered how borders affect the size of our box. Typically
                    when we add borders to an element with CSS we use a shorthand property that sets the color, width,
                    and style of the border in one line of CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can set a border for all four sides of a box with <code>border</code>:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        .box { <br>
                        border: 1px solid black; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML Elements have a natural size, set before they are affected by any CSS. A straightforward
                    example is an image. An image has a width and a height defined in the image file it is embedding
                    into the page. This size is described as the <b>intrinsic size</b> — which comes from the image
                    itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you place an image on a page and do not change its height and width, either using attributes on
                    the <img> tag or CSS, it will be displayed using that intrinsic size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can, of course, give elements in our design a specific size. When a size is given to an element
                    (the content of which then needs to fit into that size) we refer to it as an <b>extrinsic size</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to giving things a fixed size, we can ask CSS to give an element a minimum or a maximum
                    size. If you have a box that might contain a variable amount of content, and you always want it to
                    be at least a certain height, you could set the <code>min-height</code> property on it. The box will
                    always be at least this height, but will then grow taller if there is more content than the box has
                    space for at its minimum height.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A common use of <code>max-width</code> is to cause images to scale down if there is not enough space
                    to display them at their intrinsic width while making sure they don't become larger than that width.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, if you were to set <code>width: 100%</code> on an image, and its intrinsic width was
                    smaller than its container, the image would be forced to stretch and become larger, causing it to
                    look pixelated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you instead use <code>max-width: 100%</code>, the image is able to become smaller than its
                    intrinsic size, but will stop at 100% of its size.

        <section class="main-section" id="form_elements">
            <header>Form elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Many form controls are added to your page by way of the <code>&ltinput&gt</code> element — this
                    defines simple form fields such as text inputs, through to more complex fields added in HTML5 such
                    as color and date pickers. There are some additional elements, such as <code>&lttextarea&gt</code>
                    for multiline text input, and also elements used to contain and label parts of forms such as
                    <code>&ltfieldset&gt</code> and <code>&ltlegend&gt</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML5 also contains attributes that enable web developers to indicate which fields are required, and
                    even the type of content that needs to be entered. If the user enters something unexpected, or
                    leaves a required field blank, the browser can show an error message. Different browsers are
                    inconsistent in how much styling and customization they allow for such items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elements that allow for text input, such as <code>&ltinput type="text"&gt</code>, specific types
                    such as <code>&ltinput type="email"&gt</code>, and the <code>&lttextarea&gt</code> element are quite
                    easy to style and tend to behave just like other boxes on your page. The default styling of these
                    elements will differ however based on the operating system and browser that your user visits the
                    site with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the more complex input types are rendered by the operating system and are inaccessible to
                    styling. You should therefore always assume that forms are going to look quite different for
                    different visitors and test complex forms in a number of browsers.
